visual updates
ki bar - changes color with trait(I am not sure if we can change the image for color, tell me if we can't and I can supply a black/white version)
overload - stays green

draw the bar OVER the frame, calamity does this too and it allows for nicer images
the notches are only visual 
ki total/8 for amount of ki in each notch
overload/6 for amount of overload in each notch
ignore wish gui stuff
